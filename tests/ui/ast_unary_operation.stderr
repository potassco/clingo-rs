error[E0382]: use of moved value: `term`
 --> tests/ui/ast_unary_operation.rs:9:10
  |
7 |     let term: ast::Term = ast::symbolic_term(&loc, &sym).unwrap().into();
  |         ---- move occurs because `term` has type `Term<'_>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
8 |     let op = ast::unary_operation(&loc, ast::UnaryOperator::Minus, term);
  |                                                                    ---- value moved here
9 |     drop(term);
  |          ^^^^ value used here after move

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
  |
8 |     let op = ast::unary_operation(&loc, ast::UnaryOperator::Minus, term.clone());
  |                                                                        ++++++++
